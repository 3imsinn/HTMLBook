=== HTMLBook

Let's write books in HTML!

HTMLBook is built on the premise that:

* Books are timeless. The basic "book" structure has persisted for hundreds of years and will continue to persist for our lifetimes, be it in digital or print form. 
* HTML is the markup language of the world for the foreseeable future.
* Single-source document processing will remain valuable for the foreseeable future.

As such, HTMLBook can be characterized in the following ways:

* HTMLBook is a subset of XHTML5.
* HTMLBook will contain no additional elements or attributes outside of the HTML5 specification.
* All HTMLBook is HTML5, but not all HTML5 is HTMLBook.
* HTMLBook is semantically tailored to the structure of a "book" (including more complex content used in technical and reference documents).
* HTMLBook is defined with with an XML schema/DTD.
* HTMLBook templates will be written in CSS.
* HTMLBook supports both full-fledged book content, as well as shorter-form contentâ€”e.g., articles.
